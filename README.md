Each question that is answered incorrectly will subtract 5 seconds from the timer in the top right corner of the screen. If the timer hits 0 or when all the questions have been answered, the quiz will redirect to the form submit screen.

Click on the submit button to enter your initials into the webpage. The webpage will store the data until the browser has been exited.

If it the first time taking the quiz, the footer will update from "Take the quiz to get a Score" to the initials of the last high score holder's initials and the current high score.
